  <p>
    "MovaBank" is a Windows Form Application which you can do easily an operation (or transaction) such as "Add amount", "Withdraw amount" and "Transfer amount". Firstly you must register in app. You enter first/last name, username, password and complete registration. After click "Sign Up" button system will give auto-generated 16 digits card number which belongs to you especially and you will be redirected to login form. You can login to account by entering username and password. Then you will be redirected to dashboard. In dashboard, you can do operations (or transactions) which I mentioned above. Addition to these, you can logout, edit your details including password and delete your account. I remembered that all transactions are recorded by system and are stored memory of application. You can see your list of transactions by clicking "My Transactions" button. Also you can download this data as PDF by clicking "Download Report (PDF)" button.
